# GathererScraper
A tool to scrape card data from Gatherer. This is not complete, it can currently only scrape data from the search result page, no data from the card details pages. This is a starting point if you are trying to remove external dependencies, but you will need to fill out the missing functionality before it is useful.

# Alternatives
If you need card data you should start with either [Scryfall](https://scryfall.com/docs/api/bulk-data) or [MTGJson](https://mtgjson.com/)
